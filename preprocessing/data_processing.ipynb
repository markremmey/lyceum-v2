To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\\nmost part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\\ngradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\\nemancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\\naside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\\ndaily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\\nanxiety to acquire.', 'And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\\nprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\\npersons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\\nof their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\\ntraditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\\nof sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\\nsuperstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\\ncredulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\\npowerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\\nscepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\\nconservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\\nHistory and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\\ntimes, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\\nindulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\\njealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\\ningredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\\nProbability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\\ntroublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\\nsifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\\ndemands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\\nfacts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,\\nis the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical\\ncharacters can only be estimated by the standard which human\\nexperience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\\ncorrect views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\\ngreat whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\\nbeings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents\\nin their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\\nmust rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\\nthe respective probability of its details.', 'It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\\nleast, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere[1] have, perhaps,\\ncontributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\\nother three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\\nthree has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\\nus little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\\nfollow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\\nwhich critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\\neverything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\\nless of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\\ncontradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one\\nof the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in\\nstyle. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their\\ntone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have\\nread Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when\\nwe have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are\\nsomething worse than ignorant.', 'It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny\\nthe personal or real existence of men and things whose life and\\ncondition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often\\ncomforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of\\nStrauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value\\nto the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To\\nquestion the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more\\nexcusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact\\nrelated in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory\\ndeveloped from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in\\nthe same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured\\nold king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa\\nPompilius._', 'Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,\\nand the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free\\npermission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all\\nwritten tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and\\nOdyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily\\ndismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This\\ncannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because\\nit cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon\\ntestimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and\\noblivion.', 'It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\\npartly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\\ntruth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of\\nthe Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\\nof the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\\nHerodotus.', 'According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an\\nearly period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\\nGreece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\\nAlthough poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\\nCritheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\\nguardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\\nmaiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the\\nfirst fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\\nMelesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia,\\nwhither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.', '“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man\\nnamed Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\\nmarried, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he\\nreceived as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\\nher performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\\nproposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\\nwilling to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\\nif he were carefully brought up.”', 'They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\\nhad bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\\nattainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\\ndied, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\\nfollowed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great\\nsuccess, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\\nbut also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\\nin the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\\nvisitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\\nevinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\\npersuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\\ntravels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\\nwith a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was\\nfitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\\nwhich might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes\\nconsented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities\\nof the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\\ninterrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote\\nmemoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.[2] Having set\\nsail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes,\\nwho had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes,\\nwho was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\\nsuperintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\\nUnder his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\\nacquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\\nthe subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\\nwas here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\\ncity the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\\napplied himself to the study of poetry.[3]', 'But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan\\nplain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ.\\nHere his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\\none Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continued the author,\\n“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\\nrecitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also\\na poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes\\narrived”.[4]', 'But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\\nthe most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph\\non Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater\\nprobability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.[5]', 'Arrived at Cumæ, he frequented the _converzationes_[6] of the old men,\\nand delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\\nfavourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a\\npublic maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously\\nrenowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure\\nhe proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made\\nthe speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to\\nacquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer\\nto be given to his proposal.', 'The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s\\ndemand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed _Homers_, they\\nwould be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this\\ncircumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of\\nHomer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.”[7] With a love of\\neconomy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its\\ntreatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented\\nhis disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet\\ncapable of giving it renown and glory.', 'At Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\\nOne Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\\nHomer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\\nverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient\\npoetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary\\npublishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\\nAt his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of\\nthe many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\\nunintelligible than the human heart.”[8]', 'Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\\nmerchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\\nrecite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\\nprofitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\\nonce determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\\nsetting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a\\ntown of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\\nseamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\\nfavourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\\nimposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\\ndown the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.', 'At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\\nPhocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\\nreached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\\nwhich we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from\\nPithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\\npasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\\n(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\\nquickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\\ntime he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\\nplace alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\\nhim, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places\\nand untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting\\nto him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\\nand he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade\\nhim sup.[9]', '“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\\nto their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\\nGlaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\\ntheir supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\\nwhilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\\n\\nGlaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.\\nHaving finished supper, they banqueted[10] afresh on conversation,\\nHomer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had\\nvisited.', 'At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\\nresolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\\nHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\\nHomer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\\na place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\\nstory respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\\nwhat he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\\nfeeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\\nstranger to him.', 'Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,\\nassuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon\\nshowed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general\\nknowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the\\ncharge of his children.[11]', 'Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\\nisland, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\\nChios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.\\n“To this day,” says Chandler,[12] “the most curious remaining is that\\nwhich has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the\\ncoast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have\\nbeen an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape\\nis oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an\\narm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a\\nlion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low\\nrim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the\\nmountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote\\nantiquity.”', 'So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable\\nfortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,\\nthe other married a Chian.\\n\\nThe following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the\\npersonages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already\\nbeen mentioned:—\\n\\n“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards\\nMentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his\\npoem as the companion of Ulysses,[13] in return for the care taken of\\nhim when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to\\nPhemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”', 'His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to\\nvisit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is\\nsaid, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity\\nof the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,[14] he\\nsent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with\\nhim in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in\\ncelebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave\\ngreat satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon\\nfestivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,\\nwith whose children he was very popular.', 'In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,\\nnow Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his\\ndeath arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma\\nproposed by some fishermen’s children.[15]\\n\\nSuch is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we\\npossess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical\\nworthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in\\ndetail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a\\npersevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of\\ninvestigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward\\nstatements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.', '“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in\\ndoubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who\\nhave done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The\\nmajestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the\\nNile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the\\nNile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”\\n\\nSuch are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics\\nhas eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the\\nHomeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he\\nproceeds:—', '“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\\nthings makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the\\nregion of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The\\ncreations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for\\nthe most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were\\nin possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly\\nexplain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in\\nall essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”[16]', 'From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of\\nhuman nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic\\ninvestigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer\\nan individual?[17] or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an\\ningenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?', 'Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some\\ndeny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the\\ncontents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are\\nperpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our\\ndevotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know\\nwhat is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our\\nadmiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”[18]', 'But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented\\nwith the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and\\nfostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions\\nby minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some\\nattention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric\\nquestion is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to\\nprefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry\\ndetails.\\n\\nBefore, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of\\nthis unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must\\nexpress my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following\\nremarks:—', '“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the\\nbetter, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its\\noriginal composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that\\nits primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to\\nassert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not\\nthe best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive\\nconception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be\\nno judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the\\nopinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty\\nof a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\\n\\n“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\\nof Pope.—', '“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\\nof Pope.—\\n\\n“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit\\nSees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,\\nHow parts relate to parts, or they to whole,\\nThe body’s harmony, the beaming soul,\\nAre things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,\\nWhen man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”[19]', 'Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning\\nthe unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and\\ncautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,[20]\\nthe authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern\\ncritics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an\\nopinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the\\nIliad,[21] and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names[22]\\nit would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal\\nnon-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems\\nto be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what\\nare the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.', 'At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on\\nthe subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel\\nof songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and\\ngood cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs\\nwere not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about\\nPeisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”[23]', 'Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on\\nthe subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we\\nfirst meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf\\nwith so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian\\ntheory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold\\nhypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—[24]', '“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\\nturning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\\npublished, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\\nthe Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\\nno means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\\nannounced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\\nportions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\\nany compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\\nPeisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\\nthat conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\\ncould be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\\ncomposition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\\nsymmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\\nby any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\\nposterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\\nindispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\\nwas thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive\\nintegrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading\\nopponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to\\nhave been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered\\nincumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the\\nIliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the\\nbeginning.', '“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\\nPeisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\\nnowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that\\nview of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to\\ncontrovert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long\\nwritten poems, in the ninth century before the Christian æra. Few\\nthings, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\\nopposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\\nWolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh\\ncentury before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no\\nremaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early\\ninscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure\\nourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus,\\nTyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,\\ncommitted their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice\\nof doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes\\nus to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous\\nordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenæa:\\nbut for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are\\nunable to say.', '“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\\nbeginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\\nexisting habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit\\ngenerally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and\\nheard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been\\nmanuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted\\nmemory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here\\nwe only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the\\nexistence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,[25] is\\nfar less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age\\nessentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable\\ninstruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover,\\nthere is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under\\nno necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for\\nif such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification\\nfor the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the\\nexample of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of\\nChios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as\\nthe general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The\\nauthor of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a\\nblind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been\\nconscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant\\nreference to the manuscript in his chest.”', 'The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon\\nwhich even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond\\na doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a\\nconsiderable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the\\nHomeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies\\nbeen preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been\\nwritten, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more\\nlike the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble\\noriginal.', '“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other\\nGreek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,\\nthough there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of\\nSolôn. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any\\nmore determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What\\nwere the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its\\nfirst commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a\\nwritten Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\\nnot only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\\nand conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\\nvoice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\\nemphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\\nreproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive\\nit with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\\nand crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\\nbe suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\\nreaders capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\\nexperienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\\nwritten words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\\nimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\\nseem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\\nthere was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\\nIf we could discover at what time such a class first began to be\\nformed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic\\npoems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with\\nthe greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the\\nformation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle\\nof the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C.\\n630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of\\nAmorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\\nthe character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac\\nand the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the\\nprimitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\\nfrom the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a\\nchange was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of\\npublication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the\\nnearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at\\nthe old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\\npoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\\nconsidered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\\nown individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric\\nrhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and\\neulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems,\\ntherefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this\\nnewly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the\\nHomeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as well\\nas the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle\\nof the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian\\ncommerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish\\nincreased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.\\nA reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and\\nthe number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of\\nSolôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though\\nstill comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized\\nauthority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness\\nof individual rhapsodes.”[26]', 'But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of\\nthe credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following\\nobservations—', '“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,\\nthrow some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid\\ncompilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its\\npresent stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian\\nruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of\\nGrecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the\\nfame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonidês were\\nemployed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much\\nmust have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is\\nalmost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should\\nnot remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies\\nwhich no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\\nHomeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have\\nperplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\\ncaused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the\\nheroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the\\nHomeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic\\ndialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing\\ncharacteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,\\nparticularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,\\nshould not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient\\nand modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such\\na period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an\\nimperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott\\nhas done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.', '“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian\\ncompilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total\\nabsence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of\\nobservation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,\\nthe Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their\\nancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece\\nembodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and\\ninsignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their\\nancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,\\nindeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic\\nfact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against\\nthe rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain\\nof Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have\\nbeen the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the\\npreeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have\\nforced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.\\nThe songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of\\nfar inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid\\nwould have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian\\nsynod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.\\nCould France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the\\nhero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are\\nsometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its\\ndireful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic\\ncycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout\\nthe whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship\\nof an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have\\nat a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring\\nneighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the\\nalmost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the\\nquestionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled\\nin the military tactics of his age.”[27]', 'To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that\\nWolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey\\nhave never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they\\nhave failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the\\ndifficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather\\naugmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is\\nLachmann’s[28] modification of his theory any better. He divides the\\nfirst twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and\\ntreats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one\\nregular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.\\nThis, as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the\\nnarrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no\\ncontradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets\\nconcur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle\\nafter the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Eubœans;\\nTlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the\\nHalizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes\\nagain make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure,\\nthat “it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have\\nso harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.”\\nThe discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes, who is represented as dead in the\\nfifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be\\nregarded as the result of an interpolation.', 'Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the\\nsubject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian\\ntheory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character of\\nPeisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,\\nthat the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,\\nor, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by\\nPeisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In\\nshort, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of\\npre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the\\nperiod of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employês_ of\\nPeisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the\\nsilence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic\\n“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts\\nthey examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of\\nattention.', '“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves\\nconfirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad\\nor Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age\\nof Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations\\nbrought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined\\nmoney, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican\\ngovernments, the close military array, the improved construction of\\nships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of\\nreligious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,\\nfamiliar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the\\nother literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to\\nnotice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,\\nundertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into\\none large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in\\nsubstance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries\\nearlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those\\npassages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray\\nno trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been\\nheard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and\\nHesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.[29] As far as the evidences on the\\ncase, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem\\nwarranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited\\nsubstantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial\\ndivergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first\\ntrustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be\\nadded, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most\\nimportant attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to\\nGrecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the\\nanti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the\\nsubsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive\\ncontrasts between their former and their later condition.”[30]', 'On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of\\nPeisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must\\nconfess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his\\nlabours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition\\nor primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the\\nwork of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and\\nelegant mind of that Athenian[31] would lead him to preserve an ancient\\nand traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and\\nre-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat\\nthe many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,\\nor whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed\\nauthor. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we\\nare upon either subject.', 'I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the\\npreservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version\\nof the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical\\nprobability must be measured by that of many others relating to the\\nSpartan Confucius.\\n\\nI will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,\\nmade by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like\\nconsistency. It is as follows:—', '“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors\\nof some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent\\nmusic’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\\nUnited States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\\naround them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\\nspirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\\nmystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\\nwhich, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\\nwas cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\\nand down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\\nrecitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\\nprobably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\\nmemory considerably.', '“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\\npoet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most\\nprobably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\\nutility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\\nHellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them\\nby a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the\\n‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,\\nwhich, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\\ndialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\\ntherefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\\nrather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\\narrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\\narguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast\\npre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\\narrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’', '“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\\nrecording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized\\nthe hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs[32] grew under\\nhis hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem\\nunder the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays\\nof the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the\\nCid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that\\nthe poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,\\nfirst, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\\ncorruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,\\nassemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then Peisistratus,\\nand afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored\\nthe works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great\\nmeasure.”[33]', 'Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which\\nhave developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I\\nmust still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of\\nthe Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations\\ndisfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here\\nand there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of\\nthe copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a\\nhigher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or\\nenjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of\\ntheir one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari\\neum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of\\nhistorical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these\\ngreat works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal\\nevidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate\\nimpulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.', 'The minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.\\nIndeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an\\nattempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its\\nimportance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on\\nits æsthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the\\nemendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had\\nthey been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or Africanus, he\\nwould probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in\\nlaying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often\\nleast competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not\\npoets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this\\nmoment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially\\nimprove the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from\\nHerodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute\\npoints, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.', 'But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\\nexercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\\nheroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\\ndissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\\npruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their\\nwish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book\\nafter book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a\\ncollection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the\\nworks of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile\\ncounterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of\\nKnight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of\\nthe utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of\\nHomer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his\\ntheory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would\\nexplain by omitting something else.', 'Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon\\nas a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,\\nseems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies\\nattributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors.[34] Now, I will\\nventure to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in\\ntheir borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like\\nBoethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their\\nfreedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined\\nand consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the\\npresent day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be\\nhe Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more\\nequally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world\\nwith the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and the\\nsatires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to\\nsay one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the\\nrefined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this\\nsubject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric\\ntheories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather\\nthan the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the\\nliterary history of more recent times will account for many points of\\ndifficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so\\nremote from that of their first creation.', 'I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus\\nwere of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason\\nwhy corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in\\nhis day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should\\nhave given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after\\nall, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\\ntoo great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\\nappeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\\nsought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much\\nviolence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\\nlove and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\\nof the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human\\ninvention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most\\nennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the\\ncontemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the\\nvery name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a\\nmistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.', 'While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature\\nherself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in\\nbelieving in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers\\nround the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth\\nof imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am\\nfar from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a\\nrich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence\\nhe might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to\\n_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to\\npatch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style\\nand execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what\\nbad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?', 'A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other\\nbards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In\\nfact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward\\nimpressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents\\nwhich support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be\\nsome grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly\\nstamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never\\ncome to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most\\npathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and\\ngreat men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more\\nsubstantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to\\ncreate a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and\\nembellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a\\nparterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their\\nwild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will\\nrequire little acuteness to detect.', 'Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware\\nas I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,\\nit still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved\\nfor a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature\\nintended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which\\nthe greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were\\nfaith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our\\nignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary\\nlesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried\\ntouching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon\\nthe condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached\\nto the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse\\nthe scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing\\napologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic\\ndynameter.', 'Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts\\neven to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and\\nwith a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply\\nwrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots\\nwhich mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must\\ntransform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination\\nmust fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the\\nsame sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but\\nattain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely\\nsuffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of\\nHomer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer\\nthat ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.', 'And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems\\ntheir powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who\\nis evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely\\nobserves:—', '“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has\\never, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.\\nProphets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other\\nnations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is\\na feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the\\nperiod of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in\\nGreece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they\\npaid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the\\nmirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no\\nless than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity\\nand truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;\\non the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\\noutweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth\\nfrom a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and\\ntherefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which\\ncherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,\\nfrom another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down\\non his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests\\nof Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic\\nwand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast\\nassemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had\\nbeen called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal\\nspirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his\\nhappiness.”[35]', 'Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of\\nHomer”[36] is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing\\nassociation, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to\\nour minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old\\ntradition? The more we read, and the more we think—think as becomes the\\nreaders of Homer,—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the\\nFather of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire.\\nWhatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful\\nfor the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than\\nseek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of\\ntheories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with\\neach other.', 'As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not\\nincluded in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief\\naccount of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer\\nwho has done it full justice[37]:—', '“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.\\nThe text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and\\ncorrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile\\nessay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,\\nmentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited\\nthe appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was\\nuncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,\\nknow or care about that department of criticism employed in determining\\nthe genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a\\nyouthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the\\nbeginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the\\ngeneral spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and\\neven, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the\\nobjection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque\\nto be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse\\nthat order in the development of national taste, which the history of\\nevery other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost\\nascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society\\nmuch more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that\\nany popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is\\ncontained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three\\nother poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as\\nmuch reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of\\nthem were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word\\ndeltos, “writing tablet,” instead of διφθέρα, “skin,” which, according\\nto Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for\\nthat purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity;\\nand generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a\\nstrong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”', 'Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s\\ndesign, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,\\nand on my own purpose in the present edition.', 'Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his\\nearliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.\\nIt is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a\\ndisposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\\ndeeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\\nwhole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\\ntranslation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\\nwhich prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\\nattainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\\nis probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\\ncontradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\\nperfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\\nliteral translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\\nlike the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\\na practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\\nfluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\\npoet’s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those\\nwho could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be\\nsatisfied.', 'It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own\\nadvancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at\\nit as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part\\nof English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn\\nfrom our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most\\ncherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because\\nButtmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to\\nἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from\\nus to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s\\nfine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his\\ntranslation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still\\ndismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the\\nconsciousness that they must have read a very great number of books\\nbefore they have read its fellow.', 'As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up\\nwithout pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general\\nreader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer\\nfor another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of\\naccumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the\\ntext. But Pope’s version was no field for such a display; and my\\npurpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,\\nto notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original, and to give\\na few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter\\ntask I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other\\nannotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be\\nfound to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary\\nlimits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a\\ncommentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope’s\\ntranslation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of\\nmiscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily\\naccomplished.', 'THEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY.\\n\\n\\n_Christ Church_.\\n\\n\\nPOPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER', 'Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\\nwriter whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested\\nwith him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular\\nexcellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a\\nwonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most\\nexcelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the\\ninvention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:\\nthe utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which\\nmasters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art\\nwith all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but\\n“steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on\\nmanaging the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works\\nof judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the\\ninvention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can\\nonly reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,\\nwhich the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more\\nentertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are\\ninclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and\\nfruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue\\ntheir observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to\\ncomprehend the vast and various extent of nature.', 'Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\\nbeauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\\nnumber of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,\\nwhich contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of\\nwhich those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,\\neach according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things\\nare too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if\\nothers are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because\\nthey are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.', 'It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute\\nthat unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no\\nman of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.\\nWhat he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing\\nmoves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,\\nor a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or\\ndone as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by\\nthe force of the poet’s imagination, and turns in one place to a\\nhearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles\\nthat of the army he describes,', 'Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο.', '“They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.” It\\nis, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,\\nis not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its\\nfullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and\\nothers, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.\\nExact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,\\nmay have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this “vivida\\nvis animi,” in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect\\nor neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even\\nwhile we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with\\nabsurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing\\nbut its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned\\nas through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but\\neverywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in\\nsudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a\\nfurnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in\\nShakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from\\nheaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and\\neverywhere irresistibly.', 'I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in\\na manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent\\nparts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which\\ndistinguishes him from all other authors.', 'This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\\nviolence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed\\nnot enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole\\ncompass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward\\npassions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all\\nthe outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but\\nwanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and\\nboundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in\\nthe invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of\\npoetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with\\nconsidering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak\\nof it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for\\nfiction.', 'Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\\nmarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,\\nthough they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;\\nor of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional\\nepisodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of\\nan epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in\\nItaly,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the\\nmost short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet\\nthis he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and\\ncrowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and\\nepisodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose\\nschemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is\\nhurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration\\nemploys not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a\\ngenius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as\\na greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s\\npoems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The\\nother epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\\nso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\\naction, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor\\nis it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\\ninvention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of\\nstory. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up\\ntheir forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,\\nVirgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)\\ndestroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses\\nvisit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent\\nafter him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of\\nCalypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be\\nabsent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,\\nRinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he\\ngives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the\\nsame present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close\\nimitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the\\nwant from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking\\nof Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from\\nPisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea\\nand Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.', 'To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those\\ninnumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy\\nwhich Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,\\nwhat a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!\\nHow fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all\\nthe properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues\\nand vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions\\nagreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in\\nwhich no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever\\ncommendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for\\ntheir invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment\\nin having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the\\nfollowing ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then\\nbecame as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it\\nwas in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy\\ncircumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand\\nupon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all\\nthose allegorical parts of a poem.', 'The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially\\nthe machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\\ndeities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems\\nthe first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and\\nsuch a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find\\nthose authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\\nconstantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support\\nof it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\\nphilosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,\\nthat mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have\\nbeen able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:\\nevery attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the\\nvarious changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day\\nthe gods of poetry.', 'We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\\nauthor has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a\\nvariety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.\\nEvery one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\\nhave distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\\ntheir manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\\nobserved in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\\nquality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\\nof the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\\nDiomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\\nof Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\\nthe courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\\nthat of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\\nfind in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\\ngenerous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\\nfound only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\\ncharacter, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\\ngive a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\\nof Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\\nthat the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\\nopen, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\\nthis quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\\nhis prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\\nupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\\nkinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\\nmanner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\\nwhere they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\\nthose of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\\nTurnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\\nwe see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\\nSergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\\nStatius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\\nsame horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\\nHippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\\nbrothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\\ntract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\\nwriters, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\\nthe invention of Homer was to that of all others.', 'The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\\nbeing perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\\nof those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the\\nIliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. “Everything in\\nit has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is\\nacted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how\\nsmall a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the\\ndramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches\\noften consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be\\nequally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of\\nhis persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape\\nbeing applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of\\nthe author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in\\nHomer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests\\nus less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil\\nleaves us readers.', 'If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\\npresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his\\nthoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part\\nHomer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the\\ngrandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they\\nhave so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his\\nGnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.\\nAnd it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if\\nVirgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so\\nmany that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises\\ninto very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.', 'If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\\ninvention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\\ncomprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance\\nof art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\\nfecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various\\nviews presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions\\ntaken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full\\nprospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side\\nviews, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as\\nthe descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the\\nIliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no\\none bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that\\nno two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of\\nnoble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,\\nhorror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of\\nimages and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted\\nhimself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil\\nespecially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from\\nhis master.', 'If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright\\nimagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We\\nacknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught\\nthat “language of the gods” to men. His expression is like the\\ncolouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on\\nboldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and\\nmost glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.\\nAristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out\\n“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than\\nin any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing,\\na weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet\\nhis expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in\\nproportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\\ndiction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the\\nsame degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,\\nas that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass\\nin the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a\\ngreater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the\\nheat more intense.', 'To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected\\nthe compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper\\nto poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted\\nand filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise\\nconduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last\\nconsideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\\nhis invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\\nsupernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\\njoined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet\\nΚορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος,\\nand so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted\\nupon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a\\nsingle line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\\naction or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\\nepithets is a short description.', 'Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\\nshare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\\nsatisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\\nGreece, but searched through its different dialects with this\\nparticular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\\nthese as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\\naccordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\\nsmoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\\na peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\\ncustom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\\nthe words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\\nWith this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\\nfeebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\\naccent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\\nlicence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his\\nsense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his\\nrapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in\\nthe correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all\\nthese he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\\nonly the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so\\ngreat a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,\\neven without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we\\ndaily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more\\nsweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of\\npoetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be\\ncopied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\\nascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\\nadvantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\\ncadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\\nVirgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in\\nworking up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was\\ncapable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his\\nline to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has\\nnot been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the\\nonly reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than\\nthe other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our\\nauthor’s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of\\nWords. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow\\nwith so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than\\nto transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,\\nwith so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise\\nus like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,\\nalways in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of\\nverse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.', 'Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us\\nis his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of\\nhis work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more\\nextensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and\\nstrongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his\\nsentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full\\nand animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers\\nmore rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with\\nregard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his\\ncharacter. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of\\ncomparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in\\nthem, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.\\nWe ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and\\ndistinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider\\nhim, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No\\nauthor or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and\\nas Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that\\nwe are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a\\nmore eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer\\npossessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of\\nboth than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in\\ncomparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the\\nbetter artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\\nHomer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\\nleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\\nprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\\nNile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a\\nriver in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold\\ntheir battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they\\ncelebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all\\nbefore him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,\\ncalmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the\\naction; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And\\nwhen we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in\\nhis terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the\\nheavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling\\nwith the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his\\nwhole creation.', 'But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\\nnaturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to\\ndistinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As\\nprudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment\\ndecline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or\\nextravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we\\nlook upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections\\nagainst him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this\\nfaculty.', 'Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which\\nso much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\\nprobability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\\ngigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,\\nexceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become\\nmiracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit\\nsomething near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable\\nperformances. Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his\\n“myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much as\\ncontrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.', 'It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been\\nthought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this\\nfaculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine\\nitself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is\\ngrounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,\\nhowever, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes\\nare like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its\\nproportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with\\noccasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his\\nmanner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when\\nhis fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent\\nimages. The reader will easily extend this observation to more\\nobjections of the same kind.', 'If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\\nnarrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will\\nbe found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the\\ntimes he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;\\nand the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here\\nspeak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into\\nextremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a\\nstrange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,[38] “that\\nthose times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are\\nmore contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to\\nmagnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and\\ncruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned\\nthrough the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;\\nwhen the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and\\ndaughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be\\nso delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile\\noffices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of\\nHomer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity,\\nin opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs\\nwithout their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses\\ndrawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect\\nthat we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and\\nthose who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the\\nperusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations\\nand people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three\\nthousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\\nthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to\\nbe found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means\\nalone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates\\ntheir dislike, will become a satisfaction.', 'This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of\\nthe same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting\\nPhœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &c.,\\nwhich some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those\\nof the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to\\nbelong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the\\nrites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of\\nattributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all\\noccasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets\\nof great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature\\nof surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names\\nderived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction\\nof each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of\\nbirth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,\\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,\\ncomplying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive\\nadditions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something\\nparallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\\nHarefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,\\n&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for\\nthe repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the\\nworld into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the\\nbrazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine\\nrace who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by\\nthe care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.”[39] Now among the\\ndivine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in\\ncommon with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an\\nepithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their\\nfamilies, actions or qualities.', 'What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\\ndeserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\\ncourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious\\nendeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should\\nthink to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one\\nwould imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these\\ncritics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a\\nconsideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have\\nalways in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they\\noverlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and\\nmoral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which\\nmight set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man,\\nand the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of\\nthe other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;\\nas because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when\\nthe very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus\\nthat Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select\\nthose particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some\\nthat Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger\\nin his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean\\nexpressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener\\nfrom an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in\\nthe awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\\nPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to\\na fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,\\nand that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the\\ngreat reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his\\ntimes, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of\\nthis principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of\\nthe cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality\\nthe consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of\\nVirgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly\\nraise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of\\nMons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age\\nHomer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and\\nthat he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who\\nsurpassed him.', 'In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to\\nthe honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed\\nthe characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his\\nfollowers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may\\ncommit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of\\ncritics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most\\nuniversal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the\\nstrongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,\\nbut excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has\\nswallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done\\nadmitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.\\nHe showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in\\nsome of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work\\nof this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most\\nvigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the\\nfinest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit\\njoin to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have\\nonly said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of\\nnature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.', 'Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it\\nremains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\\ncharacteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,\\nsuch as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice\\nit but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in\\nevery particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too\\nmuch softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the\\nfirst grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and\\nunmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his\\nproper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to\\ntake as he finds them.', 'It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\\nour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\\nliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\\nlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that\\na rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no\\nless in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the\\nmodern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there\\nis often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a\\nversion almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but\\nthose which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,\\nand supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will\\nventure to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by\\na servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours\\nby a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.\\nIt is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator\\nshould principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his\\nmanaging: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving\\nthis to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than\\nhe finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret\\nin writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;\\nand it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in\\nhis footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours\\nas high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to\\nbe deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of\\na mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been\\nmore commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his\\ntranslators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\\nsublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\\nsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\\nsweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the\\ncertain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in\\nhis train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an\\nunaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes\\none could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be\\nenvied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of\\nstyle, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and\\nthe rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and\\ndignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as\\nmuch from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:\\nit is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.\\nSimplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.', 'This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\\nScripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the\\ninspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words\\nbut what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that\\npart of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his\\nstyle must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books\\nthan that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what\\nhas been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,\\ninduce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those\\ngeneral phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a\\nveneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;\\nas, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the\\nDivinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.', 'For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\\nshould be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\\nproverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\\nsomething venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned\\ngravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which\\nwould be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more\\ningenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.', 'Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of\\nMilton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill\\neffect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other\\nseems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of\\nmodern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,”\\nor the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be\\nallowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat\\nthe subjects in any living language.', 'There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of\\nmarks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first\\nsight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as\\ndefects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I\\nspeak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the\\nformer cannot be done literally into English without destroying the\\npurity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide\\neasily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the\\near or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which\\nhave received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are\\nbecome familiar through their use of them; such as “the\\ncloud-compelling Jove,” &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as\\nfully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded\\none, the course to be taken is obvious.', 'Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one\\nor two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the\\nepithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous\\ntranslated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a majestic idea in the\\nperiphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that\\nadmit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a\\njudicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are\\nintroduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or\\n“far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect\\nof the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,\\nwith regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where\\nApollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former\\ninterpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would\\nmake choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to\\navoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in\\nHomer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already\\nshown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one\\nmay wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an\\nadditional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in\\ndoing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his\\njudgment.', 'As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of\\nwhole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\\nhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,\\nas neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor\\nto offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not\\nungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders\\nit a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods\\nto men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or\\nwhere the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn\\nforms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the\\nbest rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the\\nrepetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one\\nmay vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed\\ntranslator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is\\nto answer for it.', 'It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)\\nis perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every\\nnew subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of\\npoetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it\\nin the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may\\nsometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed\\nof his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed\\nthis, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to\\nall others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who\\nhave, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.', 'Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing\\njustice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may\\nentertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him\\nthan any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those\\nof Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an\\nimmeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce\\nany paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent\\ninterpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the\\nthirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty\\nverses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one\\nmight think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of\\nhis notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a\\nstrong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;\\ninsomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries\\nhe had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the\\nobvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a\\nfault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the\\ntragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man may\\naccount for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and\\nremarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.\\nHis own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen\\nweeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that\\nwhich is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\\nhis defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,\\nwhich is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have\\nwrit before he arrived at years of discretion.', 'Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but\\nfor particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often\\nomits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close\\ntranslation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the\\nshortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original\\nline by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes\\nomits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of\\nmistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but\\nthrough carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is too mean for\\ncriticism.', 'It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live\\nto translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small\\npart of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly\\ninterpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be\\nexcused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to\\nhave had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,\\nand has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the\\noriginal. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more\\nhave attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom\\n(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited\\ntranslation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is\\nlike that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in\\nthe commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only\\nfor being at the head of it.', 'That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who\\ntranslates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and\\nfire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the\\nsense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as\\nmost agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of\\nhis style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,\\nin the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the\\nmore sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a\\nfulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not\\nto neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor\\nsometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound\\nany rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the\\nwhole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any\\ntranslator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What\\nI would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from\\nhis own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or\\nwhatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to\\nconsider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\\nancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\\nArchbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the\\nspirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s admirable Treatise of the\\nEpic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,\\nwith whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever\\nhappiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;\\nthose only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.\\nFor to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this\\nundertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not\\nmodern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.', 'What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am\\nprepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,\\nwho are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,\\nwhatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as\\nthey are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was\\nguided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and\\nby persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be\\ntrue, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men\\nof wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to\\nundertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion\\nin such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir\\nRichard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the\\npublic. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he\\nalways serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel\\nGarth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also\\nacknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well\\nas sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in\\ntranslating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and\\nDr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice\\nto the last, whose good nature (to give it a great panegyric), is no\\nless extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not\\nentirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But\\nwhat can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while\\nthe first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most\\ndistinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief\\nencouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,\\nthat my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to\\nthe name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not\\ndispleased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his\\nexcellent Essay), so complete a praise:', '“Read Homer once, and you can read no more;\\nFor all books else appear so mean, so poor,\\nVerse will seem prose: but still persist to read,\\nAnd Homer will be all the books you need.”', 'That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it\\nis hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing\\nto his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord\\nBolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business,\\nthan in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not\\nrefused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their\\nwriter: and that the noble author of the tragedy of “Heroic Love” has\\ncontinued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my\\nattempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing,\\nthat I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct\\nin general, but their correction of several particulars of this\\ntranslation.', 'I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the\\nEarl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one\\ngenerous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of\\nthem. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my\\ndesire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.\\nThe particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord\\nChancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his\\nfriendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others\\nof my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by\\nthe privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can\\nno way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.', 'In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted.

And I\\ncan hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when\\nI reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy\\nfriendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is\\nthe more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never\\ngratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of\\nparticular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of\\nan undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship\\nof so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those\\nyears of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a\\nmanner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.', 'THE ILIAD.\\n\\n\\nBOOK I.\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT.[40]\\n\\n\\nTHE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.', 'In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring\\ntowns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and\\nBriseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.\\nChryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of Apollo, comes to the\\nGrecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in\\nthe tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently\\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\\nrefusal of Chryseïs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\\nBriseïs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his\\nforces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she\\nsupplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her\\nson, by giving victory to the Trojans.

Diomed opposes this, and Nestor\\nseconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to\\nbe strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are\\nto be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and\\nNestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in\\norder to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice\\nof, who are accompanied by old Phœnix. They make, each of them, very\\nmoving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by\\nAchilles, who notwithstanding retains Phœnix in his tent. The\\nambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake\\nthemselves to sleep.\\n    This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,\\n    which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem.

They call\\na council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies’ camp,\\nto learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed\\nundertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for\\nhis companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had\\nsent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are\\ninformed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and\\nparticularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They\\npass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and\\nseize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in\\ntriumph to the camp.\\n    The same night continues;

In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the\\narmy, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in\\nNestor’s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)\\nsent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that\\nmanner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the\\naccidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he\\nremembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight\\nfor his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in\\nAchilles’ armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also\\nwounded, and assists him in that distress.\\n    This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and\\n    the same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended\\n    through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,\\n    seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books.

To take an ordinary case, we might refer to\\n that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short\\n warning, to ‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when laid\\n together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is\\n nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a\\n gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a\\n distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he\\n informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining a\\n man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole\\n Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also\\n to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either\\n forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first,\\n alternately the odd and even lines—in short, whatever the passage\\n required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more\\n than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could\\n produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that this\\n singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the same\\n manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which\\n we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years\\n ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person can\\n have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually\\n repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required from any\\n part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most unimportant enumeration\\n of mere proper names not excepted. We do not mention these facts as\\n touching the more difficult part of the question before us, but facts\\n they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating the extent\\n to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these days of\\n multifarious reading, and of countless distracting affairs, fair\\n judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory\\n combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded\\n people?—Quarterly Review, _l. c._, p. 143, sqq.\\n    Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, “The\\n    Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer\\n    in length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it\\n    exists only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted\\n    with writing.

During this\\n interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been\\n occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of\\n which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length\\n opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the\\n principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission\\n to make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent\\n presents. The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character,\\n persists in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the\\n verge of entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this\\n friend weeps before him, and asks for the hero’s arms, and for\\n permission to go to the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship\\n prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of\\n the general. He lends his armour to his friend, but commands him not\\n to engage with the chief of the enemy’s army, because he reserves to\\n himself the honour of that combat, and because he also fears for his\\n friend’s life. The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to\\n nothing but his courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and\\n the hero’s arms become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero,\\n given up to the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives\\n from a divinity new armour, is reconciled with his general and,\\n thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers\\n the victory, slays the enemy’s chief, honours his friend with superb\\n funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his\\n destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father\\n of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of his son,\\n which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.', '[41] Vultures: Pope is more accurate than the poet he translates, for\\n Homer writes “a prey to dogs and to _all_ kinds of birds. But all\\n kinds of birds are not carnivorous.\\n\\n [42] _i.e._ during the whole time of their striving the will of Jove\\n was being gradually accomplished.\\n\\n [43] Compare Milton’s “Paradise Lost” i. 6\\n\\n“Sing, heavenly Muse, that on the secret top\\nOf Horeb, or of Sinai, didst inspire\\nThat shepherd.”\\n\\n [44] _Latona’s son: i.e._ Apollo.\\n\\n [45] _King of men:_ Agamemnon.\\n\\n [46] _Brother kings:_ Menelaus and Agamemnon.', '[47] _Smintheus_ an epithet taken from sminthos, the Phrygian name\\n for a _mouse_, was applied to Apollo for having put an end to a plague\\n of mice which had harassed that territory. Strabo, however, says, that\\n when the Teucri were migrating from Crete, they were told by an oracle\\n to settle in that place, where they should not be attacked by the\\n original inhabitants of the land, and that, having halted for the\\n night, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away the leathern straps\\n of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment of the\\n oracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to Sminthean\\n Apollo. Grote, “History of Greece,” i. p. 68, remarks that the\\n “worship of Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its\\n neighboring territory, dates before the earliest period of Æolian\\n colonization.”', '[48] _Cilla_, a town of Troas near Thebe, so called from Cillus, a\\n sister of Hippodamia, slain by Œnomaus.\\n\\n [49] A mistake.

Throughout both poems, all deaths from\\n unforeseen or invisible causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of\\n the young child or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or\\n flower of youth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or\\n of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are\\n ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of\\n the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for\\n who could more appropriately impart to mortals what little\\n foreknowledge Fate permitted of her decrees than the agent of her most\\n awful dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song\\n explains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with\\n which he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every\\n age, no less naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any\\n connection between Apollo and the Sun, whatever may have existed in\\n the more esoteric doctrine of the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace\\n in either Iliad or Odyssey.”—Mure, “History of Greek Literature,” vol.\\n i. p. 478, sq.', '[51] It has frequently been observed, that most pestilences begin with\\n animals, and that Homer had this fact in mind.\\n\\n [52] _Convened to council_. The public assembly in the heroic times is\\n well characterized by Grote, vol. ii. p 92. “It is an assembly for\\n talk. Communication and discussion to a certain extent by the chiefs\\n in person, of the people as listeners and sympathizers—often for\\n eloquence, and sometimes for quarrel—but here its ostensible purposes\\n end.”\\n\\n [53] Old Jacob Duport, whose “Gnomologia Homerica” is full of curious\\n and useful things, quotes several passages of the ancients, in which\\n reference is made to these words of Homer, in maintenance of the\\n belief that dreams had a divine origin and an import in which men were\\n interested.', '[54] Rather, “bright-eyed.” See the German critics quoted by Arnold.\\n\\n [55] The prize given to Ajax was Tecmessa, while Ulysses received\\n Laodice, the daughter of Cycnus.', '[56] The Myrmidons dwelt on the southern borders of Thessaly, and took\\n their origin from Myrmido, son of Jupiter and Eurymedusa. It is\\n fancifully supposed that the name was derived from myrmaex, an _ant_,\\n “because they imitated the diligence of the ants, and like them were\\n indefatigable, continually employed in cultivating the earth; the\\n change from ants to men is founded merely on the equivocation of their\\n name, which resembles that of the ant: they bore a further resemblance\\n to these little animals, in that instead of inhabiting towns or\\n villages, at first they commonly resided in the open fields, having no\\n other retreats but dens and the cavities of trees, until Ithacus\\n brought them together, and settled them in more secure and comfortable\\n habitations.”—Anthon’s “Lempriere.”', '[57] Eustathius, after Heraclides Ponticus and others, allegorizes\\n this apparition, as if the appearance of Minerva to Achilles, unseen\\n by the rest, was intended to point out the sudden recollection that he\\n would gain nothing by intemperate wrath, and that it were best to\\n restrain his anger, and only gratify it by withdrawing his services.\\n The same idea is rather cleverly worked out by Apuleius, “De Deo\\n Socratis.”\\n\\n [58] Compare Milton, “Paradise Lost,” bk. ii:\\n\\n“Though his tongue\\nDropp’d manna.”\\n\\nSo Proverbs v. 3, “For the lips of a strange woman drop as an\\nhoney-comb.”', '[59] Salt water was chiefly used in lustrations, from its being\\n supposed to possess certain fiery particles.

The sacred ship of Ammon\\n is on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by\\n another boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one\\n of the most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the\\n interpretation of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of\\n Jupiter’s visit to the Ethiopians, and his twelve days’\\n absence.”—Long, “Egyptian Antiquities” vol. 1 p. 96.

Those who beheld\\n this statue are said to have been so struck with it as to have asked\\n whether Jupiter had descended from heaven to show himself to Phidias,\\n or whether Phidias had been carried thither to contemplate the god.”—\\n “Elgin Marbles,” vol. xii p.124.\\n\\n [71] “So was his will\\nPronounced among the gods, and by an oath,\\nThat shook heav’n’s whole circumference, confirm’d.”', '“Paradise Lost” ii. 351.\\n\\n [72] _A double bowl, i.e._ a vessel with a cup at both ends, something\\n like the measures by which a halfpenny or pennyworth of nuts is sold.\\n See Buttmann, Lexic. p. 93 sq.\\n\\n [73] “Paradise Lost,” i. 44.\\n\\n“Him th’ Almighty power\\nHurl’d headlong flaming from th ethereal sky,\\nWith hideous ruin and combustion”', '[74] The occasion on which Vulcan incurred Jove’s displeasure was\\n this—After Hercules, had taken and pillaged Troy, Juno raised a storm,\\n which drove him to the island of Cos, having previously cast Jove into\\n a sleep, to prevent him aiding his son. Jove, in revenge, fastened\\n iron anvils to her feet, and hung her from the sky, and Vulcan,\\n attempting to relieve her, was kicked down from Olympus in the manner\\n described. The allegorists have gone mad in finding deep explanations\\n for this amusing fiction. See Heraclides, “Ponticus,” p. 463 sq., ed\\n Gale. The story is told by Homer himself in Book xv. The Sinthians\\n were a race of robbers, the ancient inhabitants of Lemnos which island\\n was ever after sacred to Vulcan.', '“Nor was his name unheard or unadored\\nIn ancient Greece, and in Ausonian land\\nMen call’d him Mulciber, and how he fell\\nFrom heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove\\nSheer o’er the crystal battlements from morn\\nTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,\\nA summer’s day and with the setting sun\\nDropp’d from the zenith like a falling star\\nOn Lemnos, th’ Aegean isle thus they relate.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” i. 738', '“Paradise Lost,” i. 738\\n\\n [75] It is ingeniously observed by Grote, vol i p. 463, that “The gods\\n formed a sort of political community of their own which had its\\n hierarchy, its distribution of ranks and duties, its contentions for\\n power and occasional revolutions, its public meetings in the agora of\\n Olympus, and its multitudinous banquets or festivals.”', '[76] Plato, Rep. iii. p. 437, was so scandalized at this deception of\\n Jupiter’s, and at his other attacks on the character of the gods, that\\n he would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment. (See Minucius\\n Felix, Section 22.) Coleridge, Introd. p. 154, well observes, that the\\n supreme father of gods and men had a full right to employ a lying\\n spirit to work out his ultimate will.

Dion, Caligula, and Domitian were particularly fond of it, and,\\n in an extended form, we find the maxim propounded by Creon in the\\n Antigone of Sophocles. See some important remarks of Heeren, “Ancient\\n Greece,” ch. vi. p. 105.', '[87] It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting\\n and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition\\n of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of\\n the gradual and individual development of Homer’s heroes, Schlegel\\n well observes, “In bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and\\n in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief;\\n they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so Homer’s\\n heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been\\n remarked that the _Iliad_ is not definitively closed, but that we are\\n left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it. The\\n bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued _ad\\n infinitum_, either from before or behind, on which account the\\n ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite\\n extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants,\\n and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as\\n vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two\\n ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one\\n object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like\\n such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we\\n lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what\\n is to follow.”—“Dramatic Literature,” p. 75.', '[88] “There cannot be a clearer indication than this description —so\\n graphic in the original poem—of the true character of the Homeric\\n agora. The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent, not\\n often hesitating, and never refractory to the chief. The fate which\\n awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are\\n substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of\\n Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even\\n more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him\\n repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus\\n he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and squinting\\n vision.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 97.', '[89] According to Pausanias, both the sprig and the remains of the\\n tree were exhibited in his time. The tragedians, Lucretius and others,\\n adopted a different fable to account for the stoppage at Aulis, and\\n seem to have found the sacrifice of Iphigena better suited to form the\\n subject of a tragedy. Compare Dryden’s “Æneid,” vol. iii. sqq.\\n\\n [90] _Full of his god, i.e._, Apollo, filled with the prophetic\\n spirit. “_The_ god” would be more simple and emphatic.\\n\\n [91] Those critics who have maintained that the “Catalogue of Ships”\\n is an interpolation, should have paid more attention to these lines,\\n which form a most natural introduction to their enumeration.', '[92] The following observation will be useful to Homeric readers:\\n “Particular animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular\\n deities. To Jupiter, Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of\\n advanced age might be offered. An ox of five years old was considered\\n especially acceptable to Jupiter. A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig,\\n were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To\\n Ceres a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus,\\n because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to\\n Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to\\n be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices\\n was the heifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was\\n to be perfect in every limb, healthy, and without blemish.”—“Elgin\\n Marbles,” vol. i. p. 78.', '[93] _Idomeneus_, son of Deucalion, was king of Crete. Having vowed,\\n during a tempest, on his return from Troy, to sacrifice to Neptune the\\n first creature that should present itself to his eye on the Cretan\\n shore, his son fell a victim to his rash vow.\\n\\n [94] _Tydeus’ son, i.e._ Diomed.\\n\\n [95] That is, Ajax, the son of Oïleus, a Locrian. He must be\\n distinguished from the other, who was king of Salamis.', '[96] A great deal of nonsense has been written to account for the word\\n _unbid_, in this line. Even Plato, “Sympos.” p. 315, has found some\\n curious meaning in what, to us, appears to need no explanation. Was\\n there any _heroic_ rule of etiquette which prevented one brother-king\\n visiting another without a formal invitation?\\n\\n [97] Fresh water fowl, especially swans, were found in great numbers\\n about the Asian Marsh, a fenny tract of country in Lydia, formed by\\n the river Cayster, near its mouth. See Virgil, “Georgics,” vol. i.\\n 383, sq.', '[98] _Scamander_, or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising,\\n according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same\\n hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at\\n Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood,\\n Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet\\n broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke\\n successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to\\n have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of\\n the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy;\\n receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy,\\n and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer’s\\n Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was\\n called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the\\n Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to\\n the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; hence the three\\n goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared\\n before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, “yellow,”\\n was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters,\\n still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters\\n attracts the attention of travellers.', '[99] It should be “his _chest_ like Neptune.” The torso of Neptune, in\\n the “Elgin Marbles,” No. 103, (vol. ii. p. 26,) is remarkable for its\\n breadth and massiveness of development.\\n\\n [100] “Say first, for heav’n hides nothing from thy view.”—“Paradise\\n Lost,” i. 27.\\n\\n“Ma di’ tu, Musa, come i primi danni\\nMandassero à Cristiani, e di quai parti:\\nTu ’l sai; ma di tant’ opra a noi si lunge\\nDebil aura di fama appena giunge.”—“Gier.

Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad where both\\n historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a\\n connection from the remotest period, with the remainder of the work.\\n The composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place,\\n necessarily presumes its author’s acquaintance with a previously\\n existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to account for the\\n harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper\\n names, most of them historically unimportant, and not a few altogether\\n fictitious: or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are\\n condensed in these few hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over\\n the thousands which follow: equally inexplicable were the pointed\\n allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous\\n and subsequent text, several of which could hardly be of traditional\\n notoriety, but through the medium of the Iliad.”—Mure, “Language and\\n Literature of Greece,” vol. i. p. 263.', '[102] _Twice Sixty:_ “Thucydides observes that the Bœotian vessels,\\n which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to\\n be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty\\n each, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five, and Thucydides\\n supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves; and that\\n very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere passengers or landsmen. In\\n short, we have in the Homeric descriptions the complete picture of an\\n Indian or African war canoe, many of which are considerably larger\\n than the largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total\\n number of the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to\\n Thucydides, although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred\\n and eighty-six in the Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the\\n foregoing average, will be about a hundred and two thousand men.

There is a most elegant tribute to his memory in\\n the Preface to the Heroica of Philostratus.', '[243] _His best beloved_. The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall\\n (Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character of the\\n friendship subsisting between these two heroes—\\n    “One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character,\\n    is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate\\n    and durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in\\n    the earliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the\\n    comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but\\n    the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were\\n    maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic\\n    companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in\\n    traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the\\n    same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a\\n    wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to\\n    die for one another. It is true that the relation between them is\\n    not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance\\n    which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical\\n    description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it\\n    presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of\\n    Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may\\n    owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even\\n    dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the\\n    period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the\\n    Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus,\\n    whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for\\n    his higher birth and his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard\\n    which united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus,\\n    though, as the persons themselves are less important, it is kept\\n    more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the\\n    same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought\\n    complete, without such a brother in arms by his side.”—Thirlwall,\\n    Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.', '[244]\\n“As hungry wolves with raging appetite,\\nScour through the fields, ne’er fear the stormy night—\\nTheir whelps at home expect the promised food,\\nAnd long to temper their dry chaps in blood—\\nSo rush’d we forth at once.”\\n\\n—Dryden’s Virgil, ii. 479.', '[245] _The destinies ordain_.—“In the mythology, also, of the Iliad,\\n purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously\\n involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly\\n equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is\\n popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to\\n fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute\\n and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true character of the Homeric\\n deity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature\\n should bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the Iliad\\n itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter\\n laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. ‘Alas me!’ says he\\n ‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should\\n be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is\\n divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having\\n snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at\\n once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether\\n I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!’ To\\n which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man,\\n long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it—but we,\\n the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here it is clear from both\\n speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter\\n might still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of\\n the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that\\n Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another.”—Coleridge,\\n p. 156. seq.', '[246] _Thrice at the battlements_. “The art military of the Homeric\\n age is upon a level with the state of navigation just described,\\n personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and the\\n ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a large scale. The\\n chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of\\n romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a\\n captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch\\n or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself was\\n accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth\\n with a declivity outwards.

On the independence of the judicial office in\\n The heroic times, see Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 166.\\n\\n [255] _Another part_, &c.', '[255] _Another part_, &c.\\n\\n“And here\\nWere horrid wars depicted; grimly pale\\nWere heroes lying with their slaughter’d steeds\\nUpon the ground incarnadin’d with blood.\\nStern stalked Bellona, smear’d with reeking gore,\\nThrough charging ranks; beside her Rout was seen,\\nAnd Terror, Discord to the fatal strife\\nInciting men, and Furies breathing flames:\\nNor absent were the Fates, and the tall shape\\nOf ghastly Death, round whom did Battles throng,\\nTheir limbs distilling plenteous blood and sweat;\\nAnd Gorgons, whose long locks were twisting snakes.\\nThat shot their forky tongues incessant forth.\\nSuch were the horrors of dire war.”\\n\\n—Dyce’s Calaber.\\n\\n [256] _A field deep furrowed_.', '[256] _A field deep furrowed_.\\n\\n“Here was a corn field; reapers in a row,\\nEach with a sharp-tooth’d sickle in his hand,\\nWork’d busily, and, as the harvest fell,\\nOthers were ready still to bind the sheaves:\\nYoked to a wain that bore the corn away\\nThe steers were moving; sturdy bullocks here\\nThe plough were drawing, and the furrow’d glebe\\nWas black behind them, while with goading wand\\nThe active youths impell’d them. Here a feast\\nWas graved: to the shrill pipe and ringing lyre\\nA band of blooming virgins led the dance.\\nAs if endued with life.”\\n—Dyce’s Calaber.', '[257] Coleridge (Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.) has diligently\\n compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by\\n Hesiod. He remarks that, “with two or three exceptions, the imagery\\n differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the\\n difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for\\n the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no\\n exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work.\\n The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or\\n congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs\\n and Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with\\n the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence\\n however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images\\n of war, over an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the\\n fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net,\\n are minutely represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the\\n leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at\\n sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the\\n genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in\\n the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is\\n decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps,\\n that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.”', '[258] “This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in\\n the Grecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas\\n familiar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes and\\n the endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned\\n subjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the\\n Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by\\n Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the\\n commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense is\\n reserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting trials are\\n brought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and receives\\n in marriage Hebe.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 128.\\n\\n [259] _Ambrosia_.', '[259] _Ambrosia_.\\n\\n“The blue-eyed maid,\\nIn ev’ry breast new vigour to infuse.\\nBrings nectar temper’d with ambrosial dews.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, vi. 249.\\n\\n [260] “Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. He\\n stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth\\n upon nothing. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the\\n cloud is not rent under them.” Job xxvi. 6-8.', '[261]\\n“Swift from his throne the infernal monarch ran,\\nAll pale and trembling, lest the race of man,v Slain by Jove’s wrath,\\nand led by Hermes’ rod,\\nShould fill (a countless throng!) his dark abode.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, vi. 769, sqq.\\n\\n [262] These words seem to imply the old belief, that the Fates might\\n be delayed, but never wholly set aside.\\n\\n [263] It was anciently believed that it was dangerous, if not fatal,\\n to behold a deity.

Euripides, Virgil, and others, relate that\\n Polydore was sent into Thrace, to the house of Polymestor, for\\n protection, being the youngest of Priam’s sons, and that he was\\n treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent\\n with him.', '[269] “Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of\\n poetical fancy is the collision into which, in the twenty-first of the\\n Iliad, he has brought the river god Scamander, first with Achilles,\\n and afterwards with Vulcan, when summoned by Juno to the hero’s aid.\\n The overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation\\n in the character of the mountain torrents of Greece and Asia Minor.\\n Their wide, shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry, so as to be\\n easily forded by the foot passenger. But a thunder-shower in the\\n mountains, unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain, may\\n suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of\\n Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready\\n explanation from physical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at\\n the critical moment when the hero’s destruction appeared imminent,\\n might, by a slight extension of the figurative parallel, be ascribed\\n to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric\\n moisture.”—Mure, vol. i. p. 480, sq.', '[270] Wood has observed, that “the circumstance of a falling tree,\\n which is described as reaching from one of its banks to the other,\\n affords a very just idea of the breadth of the Scamander.”\\n\\n [271] _Ignominious_. Drowning, as compared with a death in the field\\n of battle, was considered utterly disgraceful.\\n\\n [272] _Beneath a caldron_.\\n\\n“So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,\\nThe bubbling waters from the bottom rise.\\nAbove the brims they force their fiery way;\\nBlack vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, vii. 644.', 'Dryden’s Virgil, vii. 644.\\n\\n [273] “This tale of the temporary servitude of particular gods, by\\n order of Jove, as a punishment for misbehaviour, recurs not\\n unfrequently among the incidents of the Mythical world.”—Grote, vol.\\n i. p. 156.\\n\\n [274] _Not half so dreadful_.\\n\\n“On the other side,\\nIncensed with indignation, Satan stood\\nUnterrified, and like a comet burn’d,\\nThat fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\\nIn the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\\nShakes pestilence and war.”\\n\\n—“Paradise Lost,” xi. 708.', '—“Paradise Lost,” xi. 708.\\n\\n [275] “And thus his own undaunted mind explores.”—“Paradise Lost,” vi.\\n 113.\\n\\n [276] The example of Nausicaa, in the Odyssey, proves that the duties\\n of the laundry were not thought derogatory, even from the dignity of a\\n princess, in the heroic times.\\n\\n [277] _Hesper shines with keener light_.\\n\\n“Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,\\nIf better thou belong not to the dawn.”\\n\\n“Paradise Lost,” v. 166.', '“Paradise Lost,” v. 166.\\n\\n [278] Such was his fate.

The following lines deserve\\n comparison:—', '“The haughty Dares in the lists appears:\\nWalking he strides, his head erected bears:\\nHis nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,\\nAnd loud applauses echo through the field.\\n* * * *\\nSuch Dares was, and such he strode along,\\nAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throng\\nHis brawny breast and ample chest he shows;\\nHis lifted arms around his head he throws,\\nAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows.\\nHis match is sought, but, through the trembling band,\\nNo one dares answer to the proud demand.\\nPresuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,\\nAlready he devours the promised prize.\\n* * * *\\nIf none my matchless valour dares oppose,\\nHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 486, seq.', 'Dryden’s Virgil, v. 486, seq.\\n\\n [292]\\n“The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore\\nHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:\\nHis mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple flood,\\nAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.”\\n\\nDryden’s Virgil, v. 623.\\n\\n [293] “Troilus is only once named in the Iliad; he was mentioned also\\n in the Cypriad but his youth, beauty, and untimely end made him an\\n object of great interest with the subsequent poets.”—Grote, i, p. 399.\\n\\n [294] Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of\\n Gabriel, “Paradise Lost,” bk. v. 266, seq.', '“Down thither prone in flight\\nHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\\nSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,\\nNow on the polar winds, then with quick fan\\nWinnows the buxom air. * * * *\\n* * * *\\nAt once on th’ eastern cliff of Paradise\\nHe lights, and to his proper shape returns\\nA seraph wing’d. * * * *\\nLike Maia’s son he stood,\\nAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill’d\\nThe circuit wide.”\\n\\nVirgil, Æn. iv. 350:—', 'Virgil, Æn. iv. 350:—\\n\\n“Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds\\nHis flying feet, and mounts the western winds:\\nAnd whether o’er the seas or earth he flies,\\nWith rapid force they bear him down the skies\\nBut first he grasps within his awful hand\\nThe mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;\\nWith this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;\\nWith this he drives them from the Stygian waves:\\n* * * *\\nThus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,v And drives the racking\\nclouds along the liquid space.”\\n\\nDryden.', '[295] In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of\\n Coleridge are well worth reading:—\\n    “By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of\\n    expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most\\n    peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from\\n    them with the completest success. The whole scene between Achilles\\n    and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose\\n    of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly\\n    skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the\\n    Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of\\n    Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if\\n    genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil\\n    the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this\\n    account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is\\n    called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the\\n    poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of\\n    Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in\\n    gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,\\n    lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is\\n    softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\\n    the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\\n    geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\\n    Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage\\n    defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no\\n    name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can\\n    only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to\\n    transfuse it into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.', '[296] “Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot\\n but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic\\n age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive\\n vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by\\n the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil\\n inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but\\n made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the\\n body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites\\n essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of\\n the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary\\n shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus\\n to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows\\n how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must\\n have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death,\\n was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding\\n up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for\\n even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure,\\n vol. i. 289.', '[297] Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.\\n\\n“Here, from the tow’r by stern Ulysses thrown,\\nAndromache bewail’d her infant son.”\\n\\nMerrick’s Tryphiodorus, v. 675.', '[298] The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant\\n and interesting view of Helen’s character—\\n    “Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand\\n    that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us\\n    also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is\\n    through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech,\\n    noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which\\n    higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate\\n    towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always\\n    thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and\\n    hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as\\n    almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is another striking\\n    instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which\\n    so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the\\n    rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.', '[299] “And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to\\n exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied\\n him through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of\\n his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full\\n influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his\\n great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few\\n short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be\\n suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.\\n    The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the\\n    Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero’s course, and the\\n    moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among\\n    the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the\\n    whole framework of the poem is united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201.', '[300] Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without\\n expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is\\n like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained\\n magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet\\n without much ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination\\n of “Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.', 'Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.
